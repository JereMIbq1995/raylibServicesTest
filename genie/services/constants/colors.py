"""
    Here are a few basic colors defined in RGB format.
    
    Also note that there can be a 4th entry that specifies
    opacity of the color. For example, a see-through BLACK would be:
    (0, 0, 0, 100)

    Opacity goes from 0 to 255, with 0 being completely vanished and
        255 being completely not see-through-able
